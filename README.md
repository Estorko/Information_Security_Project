The first block of code are the pip installations needed to run the packages. If these are needed then pls uncomment the block of code by removing the """ at the start and running the whole code again. Now for some reason the code doesn't work on Google collab when we tested it, our suspicion is because we google collab maybe has a different python version than ours (we’re running on python 3.10.7 64-bit version- on Visual Studio Code). 
For safety measures we’ve uploaded the code to GitHub where the output can be clearly seen, in case there is some error running the code, pls refer to our repository at: https://github.com/Estorko/Information_Security_Project
